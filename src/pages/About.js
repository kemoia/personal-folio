        <h1 className='title' >ABOUT ME!</h1>
        <h3 id='about-info'>My name is Kemoia. I was born in Jamaica. In the future I want to become a software developer that also dangles her feet in
                accounting and buisness. Of course I love software developing more but I cannot deny or ignore my
                passion for accounting. Who knows? Maybe one day I may create a program that is specifically designed
                for banks. With that I could ensure that I get the best of both worlds. I would describe myself as a
                self-driven and self-motivated person, everyone around me could be tearing me down and doubting me but
                if I put my mind to something, I know I will get it done and I will give it my very best shot. I'm so
                glad I live in a day and age where technology is so needed as well as most if not everything can be
                found on the internet. I am really excited to see where tech inventries will be in the next few years
                and I am hopefull that I will be apart of it.
